# Overview

This project was made to showcase my process in designing the classic pong game in pygame. Here I have mulitple iterations of pong where I tackle different issues rather than making one single program. 

This project also includes plans to eventuatlly add sound and music to fully flesh out the project.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
